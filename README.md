# jovian-web-scraping

This is the web scraping project for the Data Science Bootcamp held by Jovian (Oct 2022). In this notebook, I have:
* Scraped most recent topic-specific questions asked on Stackoverflow.com using Requests & BeautifulSoup4 
* Built functions to automatically retrieve question title, inquirer, time posted, the popularity of the question, etc. 
* Acquired additional information which is not directly visible on the main summary page.
